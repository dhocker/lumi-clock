# LumiClock
Copyright Â© 2018 by Dave Hocker

## Overview
This project is a relatively simple digital clock app that was inspired
by the Lumitime clocks of the '70s and '80s. It uses Tkinter for
the GUI and the Pillow package for implementing an animated GIF.
It was originally conceived as a Raspberry Pi based project.

The clock display takes over the enitre screen. It displays the current time,
an AM/PM indicator and a spinner (an animated GIF). The time display
is sized so that it looks good on a tablet sized display (say 7"-8").

## Configuration File
The first time you run LumiClock it creates a default configuration file
in a location determined by your OS.

* Windows: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\lumiclock\lumiclock.conf
* Linux and macOS: ~/lumiclock/lumiclock.conf

The configuration file contains settings for several items.
* font: The default font is Courier New. A fixed pitch font works best.
A good mono-space digital font is
["Digital-7 Mono"](https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font).
* color: Sets the foreground color of the font. The default color
is "#EC3818" which is an approximation of the color of the original
Lumitime clock's digits. This color does not affect the spinner.
* spinner: Selects the default GIF file for the spinner. The
default is "spiral_triangles.gif". There are a number of GIF files
in the project directory.
* loglevel: Selects the level of logging (debug, warning, info, error)
The default is "debug".

## Spinner
The spinner is a 128x128 animated GIF. The project includes several
spinners that were generated with the default color (#EC3818). You can
generate your own spinners and place them in the project directory.
[Chimply](http://www.chimply.com/Generator) is a good site for
generating animated GIFs.

## User Interface
Touching the screen or a left mouse click will cause a context menu
to be shown. The context menu contains a list of the spinner GIFs
that are available and other program actions (like Quit). Any GIF in
the project directory will be shown on the context menu. Thus, if you
add your own GIFs they will show on the context menu.
